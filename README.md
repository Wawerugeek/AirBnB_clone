AirBnB_clone -  Console 

Project Description 
This is the first phase of the project that simulates a full web application - Airbnb application. We are developing a way to control the modules that our application is going to use. Weâ€™ll start by coding a console which will help us interact with our initial file storage system. The console interpreter creates the data model and allows us to create, retrieve, update,  destroy, and persist objects to a JSON file. 

Command Interpreter.
